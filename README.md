#### According to TheIndianEXPRESS,
In one study, researchers from universities in Arizona, Harvard and Sydney have, using mathematical models for population in New York, shown that if 70% of people wore an effective professional mask every time they ventured outdoors, the pandemic could be eliminated from the city. The same result could be achieved in the entire US, if at least 80% of the population regularly used masks.

Even low-quality home-made masks could lead to significant reduction in the spread of the disease, though other interventions would also be required in that case to achieve elimination, the study said.

“Using face-masks in public (including low-efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimising community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with strict social distancing strategy,” the researchers have said in their study.

The study also found that up to 45% of the deaths projected in New York over the next two months could be prevented if 80% of the people started using some sort of mask.

“It will be another 12 to 18 months until mass vaccination or herd immunity finally becomes a reality. In the meanwhile, we need to start respecting the mask, change our behaviour and start getting used to this new face accessory on an immediate basis,” said Dr Sundeep Salvi, vice-president of the Indian Chest Society and member of several task forces and committees appointed by central and Maharashtra governments to help tackle the pandemic.


#### So for forcing people to wear masks in public areas my this model could play a vital role. 
#### Idea:
We can put CCTV cameras at the entrance gates of public places like malls, shops, etc, and then using my model we can create a automated system that only allows person wearing mask. WHich could really bring a huge change in current pandemic situation due to COVID-19.

#### About the Project:
1. This uses Haarcascade models for some kind of detections of face parts.
2. Using OpenCV for streaming video or footage.
3. Gives real-time results.
